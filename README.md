# Adaptative_Particle_Filter
Python Implementation of our paper 'Rapid Localization and Mapping method based on Adaptive Particle Filters'

- The main file to run the method is the jupyter notebook 'Untitled1.ipnyb'
- The Adaptative particle fitler function exist in file 'particlefilter.py'
- The 'Method1.py' file contain several functions to extracte function, create global mapping, and localization (also to read NCLT Data)
- To read the kitti dataset use the file 'kittiwarppers.py' 
- Some useful functions to jump between coordinates and so many things 'util.py'
